I acquired fundamental Front-End Development knowledge through a bootcamp at Armenian Code Academy and courses at Microsoft IC Armenia.
Then, at Cognaize Engineering LLC, I continued to improve my skills by working on a variety of tasks, including redesigning elements, debugging, and implementing new features.
Alongside this, I worked on personal projects and freelancing.
And now, with 2 years of hands-on experience, I'm excited to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects!
