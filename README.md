I have acquired fundamental knowledge in Front-End Development
at Armenian Code Academy's "Front-End Bootcamp".
Then, I honed my skills at Cognaize LLC working on tasks ranging
from redesigning elements and debugging to adding new features.
And now, with a year of hands-on experience, I am ready to embrace
new challenges and contribute to innovative projects.
